<h1>SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager) - Azure Sentinel</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this SIEM project, I'll set up a free Azure subscription Then, I'm creating a virtual machine with intentionally turned off firewalls to make it a tempting target for attackers. We'll manage logs in Azure's Log Analytics Workspace and use Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's SIEM, to map out attacker data. Adding a cool twist, I'll use PowerShell to extract and enrich IP address data for a deeper dive into cybersecurity threats.

I created a functional Active Directory environment using Oracle VirtualBox. This involved setting up a domain controller, configuring IP addressing, and installing Active Directory services. I also automated user creation with PowerShell and created a client machine connected to the domain. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of Active Directory and Windows networking, providing valuable skills for network administration and system management.
