<h1>SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager) - Azure Sentinel</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In the Active Directory Home Lab project, I created a functional Active Directory environment using Oracle VirtualBox. This involved setting up a domain controller, configuring IP addressing, and installing Active Directory services. I also automated user creation with PowerShell and created a client machine connected to the domain. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of Active Directory and Windows networking, providing valuable skills for network administration and system management.

The network diagram illustrates the Active Directory Home Lab's structure. It features a Domain Controller (DC), a Client Machine, and two network connections: Internal (for internal communication) and External (providing internet access and routing for private network clients). This visual aids in understanding the project's network configuration. <br/>
